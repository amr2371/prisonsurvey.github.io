<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Exploratory Data Analyses</h1>

</div>


<p>To conduct our exploratory and statistical data analyses, we first
imported the datasets containing observations of both state and
federally incarcerated individuals from the
<code>Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities, [United States], 2004 (ICPSR 4572)</code>
into R. We also selected our variables of interest to pare down the
datasets.</p>
<p>We next stacked these two datasets using a newly created variable
called <code>dataset</code> to identify which original file each
observation was from (i.e., state vs. federal). We cleaned the resulting
data by checking for coding errors, recoding various factor variables,
adding variable labels, and changing the coding of values from
<code>missing</code>/<code>don't know</code>/<code>unknown</code> to
<code>NA</code> for consistency.</p>
<p>This tidying and cleaning resulted in a combined dataset with
<code>17881</code> rows (observations) and <code>60</code> columns
(variables). The resulting dataset includes demographic, geographic,
incarceration-related, and health-related variables.</p>
<div id="demographics" class="section level2">
<h2>Demographics</h2>
<p>To examine the distribution of demographic variables across our
dataset, we created a tabular display of variables sex
(<code>V0005</code>), age group (<code>AGE_CAT</code>), and
race/ethnicity (<code>V2982</code>).</p>

<p>From this table, we can see that certain variables appear to differ
by mental health history, one of our primary outcomes of interest.
Therefore, we have performed some hypothesis testing on the <a
href="stat_tests.html">Statistical Analysis</a> page to assess whether
the observed differences are significant.</p>

<p>When displayed on a bar graph, the two groups of mental health
history have similar distributions of educational attainment, but
categories from 10th-12th grade appear to have higher proportions of
individuals with no mental health history, whereas the college-level
categories interestingly have a higher proportion of individuals
<em>with</em> a history of mental health condition(s).</p>

<p>With regard to monthly income in the month before arrest, the two
categories of mental health history do not have easily distinguishable
patterns/distributions. However, in the lower income categories (up to
the <code>$800 - $999</code> category), there are a higher proportion of
individuals with a history of mental health condition(s) - the opposite
is true for all categories including and above
<code>$1,000 - $1,199</code>.</p>

History</h3>
<p>Subsequently, a table was created to display the distribution of
variables related to individuals’ current incarceration and/or history
regarding the justice system. These variables included number of prior
sentences (<code>CH_PRIORSENTENCE_NUM</code>), number of prior arrests
(<code>V1197</code>), collapsed criminal history
(<code>CH_CRIMHIST_COLLAPSED</code>), whether their parents have been
incarcerated (<code>SES_PARENTS_INCARCERATED</code>), whether their
other immediate family has been incarcerated
(<code>SES_FAMILY_INCARCERATED</code>), and whether they are
incarcerated in a state or federal facility (<code>dataset</code>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Incarceration table

<p>Again, some of these variables appear to differ by mental health
history status, so some hypothesis testing is shown on the Statistical
Analysis page of the website, which examines this further.</p>

both categories.</p>

<p>The density plot above shows that the distributions of the number of
prior arrests are extremely similar for both categories of mental health
history. Most of the same peaks are observed in each distribution,
suggesting there may be something significant about these seemingly
arbitrary numbers of arrests. However, it does seem like a higher
proportion of individuals with no mental health history have 0 to
roughly 5 arrests compared to inmates with mental health
condition(s).</p>

<p>The bar graph above restricts our analysis of treatment continuation
to only those individuals with a history of mental health condition(s)
as indicated by the <code>MENTAL_HISTORY_BINARY</code> variable. Among
those survey respondents, it found that roughly two-thirds of
individuals either had constant treatment status before and after
incarceration (either no treatment -&gt; no treatment or yes treatment
-&gt; yes treatment). Almost one-third of individuals began treatment
while incarcerated and less than 10% had received treatment before
incarceration but were no longer doing so.</p>

<p>Finally, the table above illustrates HIV status
(<code>MCMH_RSLT_HIV</code>) for those with and without a history of
mental health condition(s). We utilize the value label
<code>presumed negative</code> as opposed to <code>negative</code>
because the variable used for analysis codes HIV status as either “at
least one positive test” or “at least one negative and the other
unknown” based on HIV testing status from both before and after
incarceration. The tabular analysis demonstrates an HIV prevalence of
roughly 1.3% for our total cross-sectional sample of incarcerated
individuals, which appears to differ somewhat between those with and
without a history of mental health condition(s) (1.7% and 1.1%,
respectively).</p>
